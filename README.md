# Itho-controller
pcb and firmware to control a itho ventilation unit

This is a project to control a itho ventilation unit via a wireless connection

It will use a NXP LPC1549 processor and a TI CC1150 transmitter

To send commands to the ventilation unit i will use the library written by Rogier Reedijk
see his blog http://www.progz.nl/blog/index.php/2014/12/reverse-engineering-remote-itho-cve-eco-rft-part-1/

Other parts of the firmware will be written by myself or when i find usefull libraries on the net i will
use these or parts of them

for now i only have the schematics and the layout of the pcb i will use.
Since i am not a HF designer i used the demo schematics of Texas Instrument for the HF transmitter part
and a bord of Adafruit as an example for a microphone input.

The board is in production now and i will receive the finished pcb's on 6 or 7 april 2016 
When i have the boards i start to assemble them and start writing the firmware

I will start posting updates as soon as i have parts working :)
