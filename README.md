# Itho-controller
pcb and firmware to control a itho ventilation unit

This is a project to control a itho ventilation unit via a wireless connection

It will use a NXP LPC1549 processor and a TI CC1150 transmitter

To send commands to the ventilation unit i will use the library written by Rogier Reedijk
see his blog http://www.progz.nl/blog/index.php/2014/12/reverse-engineering-remote-itho-cve-eco-rft-part-1/

Other parts of the firmware will be written by myself or when i find usefull libraries on the net i will
use these or parts of them

for now i only have the schematics of the pcb i will use.
